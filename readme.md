## PHONE BOOK
Server site: http://localhost:8000/phonebook <br>
This is a pseudo phone book that enables a client to send an .xml file to a server. <br>
The .xml is parsed into a json format and later handled by the server. <br>
The systems assumes the following: <br>
* The formatting of the xml file
* The client uses the server site to view all of his clients
* That all of the contacts have unique names
* You have to change the path in the .java file if you want to send a custom .xml file
